# kata-url-shortener

This project is a KATA exercise to learn and practice NEST JS and TDD by building a simple url-shortener.

## What is KATA ?

A KATA is an exercise used to master the repetitive or mechanical aspects of a task. In software development, practicing and refining these aspects is crucial because it saves time and allows us to focus more on the creative aspects of the task.

## How to KATA ?

1. Pick a task to work on.

2. In the first iteration, focus on solving the problem without worrying about the time. Take your time to come up with the ideal solution.

3. Once you are in a good place, start over from scratch, but this time without the creative challenges since they were solved in the first iteration.

4. Measure the time taken to complete the task.

5. Practice the task repeatedly until you become comfortable with the mechanical aspects, allowing you to focus more on the creative parts.

## Why URL Shortener?

I chose this project because it covers various key areas of NestJS, like CRUD operations, URL redirection, database integration, and other essential features, providing a hands-on way to practice and solidify these concepts.
